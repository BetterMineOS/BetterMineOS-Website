# BetterMineOS-Website

A website to do all the CLI does

## Roadmap

- Simple web page that shows exactly what the user would see if they launched their game
- User Authentication
- View for authenticated user to decide what servers are shown
- View for authenticated user to execute the cli commands on the servers
- View for authenticated user to see statistics for the server
- View for authenticated user to edit server files? (Possibly a security issue!)
